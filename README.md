## Introduction   
This case study is part of the Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization. 

## About Social Buzz 
Social Buzz was founded by two former engineers from a large social media conglomerate, one from London and the other from San Francisco. They left in 2008 and both met in San Francisco to start their business. They started Social Buzz because they saw an opportunity to build on the foundation that their previous company started by creating a new platform where
content took center stage. Social Buzz emphasizes content by keeping all users anonymous, only tracking user reactions on every piece of content. There are over 100 ways that users can react to content, spanning beyond the traditional reactions of likes, dislikes, and comments. This ensures that trending content, as opposed to individual users, is at the forefront of userfeeds.
